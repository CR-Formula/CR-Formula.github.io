# Software
Software refers to the webpages and executables run on personal devices developed by us. Most software previously was developed using Java, since the start of CR-29 we've decided to change our direction and move to TypeScript. This section of the wiki will cover how to setup your personal computer environment (as of CR-29) so you may start development. This section will also cover previous projects and theories of design/development.
