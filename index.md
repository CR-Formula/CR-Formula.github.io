# CR-Formula Documentation and Wiki Site
This is the Github pages site used by Iowa State CR-Formula team to host the Electrical Wiki as well as the documentation for software and electronics. The wiki covers good resources for learning how to design embedded firmware, hardware, and software as well as instructions for how to setup build enviorments and programs. These instructions are found in their respective Wiki sections. The Documentation section includes design documents and files for past cars and systems, as well as information and lessons learned from each year. This site should stay as up to date as possible in order to keep information accessable to new members and allow everyone to get up to speed quickly.
