# CR-28
This is the home page for CR-28 Documentation. CR-28 was built in the 2023-2024 Season and was the third version of the Telemetry System. The team lead was Alex Bashara. This system was the second run of custom PCBs and was also the year that started the devlopment of STM32 based solutions. CR-28 origonally ran with a modified/improved version of CR-27's system and was later retrofitted with CR-28's STM32 based solution.
