# CR-Formula Documentation and Wiki Site
This is the Github pages site used by Iowa State CR-Formula team to host the Electrical Wiki as well as the Documentation for software and electronics. The Wiki covers good resources for learning how to design embedded software and hardware, as well as instructions for how to setup build enviorments and programs. The Documentation section includes design documents and files for past cars and systems. This site should stay as up to date as possible in order to keep information accessable to new members and allow everyone to get up to speed quickly.
