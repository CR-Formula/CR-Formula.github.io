# Hardware
Hardware refers to the PCB and circuit design that is used in the embedded systems. The team uses Altium to design boards, LTSpice to simulate circuits, and RapidHarness to design wiring harnesses. The hardware design consists of both digital an analog circuits. The wiki provides guides and resources for getting up to speed on Altium and circuit design. To get started, look at the [Design Software] page and setup Altium. Once you have Altium setup, you can learn how to use it to design circuits and PCBs on the [Altium] page.
