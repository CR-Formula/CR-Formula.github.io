- [CAN](https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/can-bus-simple-intro-tutorial) - (Controller Area Network) - A [vehicle bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_bus) standard designed to allow [microcontrollers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digital-logic/microcontroller-and-its-types/) and devices to communicate with each other's applications. It is a [differential](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/the-why-and-how-of-differential-signaling/), [message-based protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing) that uses two wires to communicate 

- [I2C](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c/all) - (Inter-Integrated Circuit -- "I Squared C") - a [synchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_circuit), [single-ended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-ended_signaling), [serial communication bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication). It is widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication. Here is a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAvawEcxoPU) explaining the protocol. 

- [SPI](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-peripheral-interface-spi/all) - (Serial Peripheral Interface -- "Spy") - A [synchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_circuit) [serial communication bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication), used primarily in embedded systems for short-distance wired communication between integrated circuits. It uses a Master/Slave architecture where the master controls the clock and uses chip select pins to determine which device to interface with. 

- [PCB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board) - (Printed Circuit Board) - a medium used to connect or "wire" components to one another in a circuit. It takes the form of a [laminated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamination) sandwich structure of conductive and insulating layers: each of the conductive layers is designed with a pattern of [traces](https://www.pcbgogo.com/Blog/PCB_Trace___Everything_You_Need_To_Know.html), [planes](https://resources.pcb.cadence.com/blog/2020-the-pcb-ground-plane-and-how-it-is-used-in-your-design) and other features (similar to wires on a flat surface) etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate. 

- [Telemetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry) - the on site collection of measurements or other data at remote points and their automatic transmission to receiving equipment (telecommunication) for monitoring. 

- [Embedded Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system) - a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system. 

- [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) - (Long Range Wide Area Network -- "Laura WAN") - license-free sub-gigahertz radio frequency wireless standard. Used to send small amounts of data over long distances.
