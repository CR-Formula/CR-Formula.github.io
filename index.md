# CR-Formula Documentation and Wiki Site
This is the GitHub pages site used by Iowa State CR-Formula team to host the Electrical Wiki as well as the documentation for software and electronics. The wiki covers good resources for learning how to design embedded firmware, hardware, and software as well as instructions for how to setup build environments and programs. These instructions are found in their respective Wiki sections. The Documentation section includes design documents and files for past cars and systems, as well as information and lessons learned from each year. This site should stay as up to date as possible in order to keep information accessible to new members and allow everyone to get up to speed quickly.

# New Members
Start by exploring the Wiki section of the part of the subsystem you are interested in and getting build environments and software setup. If you have any questions about the setup process, ask and the team will update the instructions as well. The recommended where to start should be listed on the main page of Firmware/Software/Hardware subsections.
