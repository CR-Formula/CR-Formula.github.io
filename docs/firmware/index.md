# Firmware
Firmware refers to the low level drivers and application code that run on the embedded processors. All of the firmware is written in C, with a few startup files in assembly. This section of the wiki covers how to setup your firmware development environment and resources for learning more about the firmware/development. To get started, go to the [Build Environment] page and setup your build environment. Once your build environment is setup, you can continue on to learn more about how to develop the firmware by referencing the rest of the wiki.
