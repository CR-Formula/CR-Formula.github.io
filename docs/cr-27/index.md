# CR-27
This is the home page for CR-27 Documentation. CR-27 was built in the 2022-2023 Season and was the second version of the Telemetry System. The team leads were Vaughn Miller and Alex Bashara. The system was the first iteration of PCBs and used an Arduino Mega as the main MCU, a Sparkfun CAN shield for CAN communication, and an ESP32 for wireless transmission.
