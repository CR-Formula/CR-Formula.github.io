# CR-29
This is the home page for CR-29 Documentation. CR-29 was built in the 2024-2025 Season and was the first EV car. The team lead was Henry Eichten. CR-29 greatly expanded the requirements from the Electrical subsystem. This includes more boards and software to assist with charging, tractive system, greater wiring demands, and more sensors. This is reflected in the increase in number of boards as well as increase in software demand.
