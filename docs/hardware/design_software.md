# Altium
Altium is the primary eCAD design program that we use. This is used to design circuit schematics and PCBs. In order to get Altium setup, sign up for a student account on [Altium's website](https://www.altium.com/education/students). When setting up an account, you can search for and join the Cyclone Racing workspace. You should also request a student professional license.

# LTSpice
LTSpice is a free circuit simulation program. It is used to simulate analog circuits to make sure that they will behave the way that the designer is expecting them to. This program is very useful for testing a lot of the all analog circuits that are required on the EV car. You can install LTSpice for free on their [downloads page](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html). This program is also used in EE201 and EE230 so it is a useful tool to know about.

# RapidHarness
RapidHarness is the software that we use to create wiring harness diagrams. This program allows us to map out our wiring runs and connectors easily. This is extremely useful when we are trying to wire the car. In order to install RapidHarness, you can download it for free from the [RapidHarness website](https://rapidharness.com/download).
